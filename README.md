# Training RL agent to play Lunar Lander

Employing 2 classes of algorithms to train RL agents to play Lunar Lander: DQN algorithms and PPO algorithms. Within each family, variants of the algorithms are implemented.

Please refer to the README.md in the 2 subfolders for installation and execution of the relevant algorithms.
